        <p title="ST. LAWRENCE COLLEGE">St. Lawrence is one of the college that is located in the heart of Chabahill, Kathmandu. It belongs to many colleges which had been in controversies regarding sexual harrasment among girl students.
            It is just like every other college claiming that they are among the best in the nation , as a student in the same college I can assure you that this is nowhere near among the best college among the nation , not only the nation i can assure this is not the best college in Chabahill, in fact Texas international college is more better than Saint lawrence. <br>This college is also among the college that donot care about students but all the care and priority goes towards different fees which is far more than the actual fees that are set by Nepal government.

        <p title="TEXAS INTERNATIONAL COLLEGE">
            texas international college is also a college located in Chabahill, Kathmandu. The college has better learning environment than the above mentioned college and claimms to have better results regarding the students' exam. The college is not so self claimed but is actually praised by the students that there is better learning environment in that price range. The college is associated with Tribhuvan University and National Examination board. As we know that ecerything comes in a price, hence the better learning environment also comes with a price and this college is slightly expensive than St. lawrence college. 
            This college also prioritise fees over students and has come into many controversies regarding threatening students about timely payment of fees regardless of their situation and time. <br>But as of me i would still consider it better than St. lawrence.

        <P title="VS COLLEGE">
            I donot know what the hell are they trying to do. All that they care about is money not education because they donot have good teachers and all the better results that they are actually from buying exam centers and letting their students cheat.
            So as a young SEE passout , they will want to go to these colleges so that they will have better results wihtout studying.
